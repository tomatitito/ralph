Work on building the `ralph-loop` application that is described in `specs/readme.md` and has a formal specification in `RalphLoop.tla` and `RalphLoop.cfg`. Pick whatever phase/task from `specs/implementation_plan.md` file you deem appropriate. When you have finished the task, update the `specs/implementation_plan.md` file to reflect the completion of the task. Then commit and push your changes.

Complete when:
- There is a working implementation of the `ralph-loop` application in `ralph-loop-rs/`.
- All tests pass.
- The TLA+ specification is verified.
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
