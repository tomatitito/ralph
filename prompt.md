Work on what is described in `plan.md`. Pick the next highest priority task that's not yet completed. When you have completed it, mark it as completed in the plan file. Your work is done when there are no open points in the plan.md and everything has been implemented.

Complete when:
- All tests should pass.
- ralph-loop application should still work as it does now.
- Viewing a file with the viewer should look like intended.
- It should be possible to select iteration files to view.
- New functionality is properly tested.
- ralph-loop can start itself in a tmux session with a given prompt, and logs are viewable in that session.
- ralph-loop can start the viewer in a separate tmux session, where transcripts are viewable.
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
