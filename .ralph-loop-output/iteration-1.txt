The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I have completed the implementation of the `ralph-loop` application in Rust. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Complete
- **Phase 1-8**: All phases implemented in `/home/sprite/ralph/ralph-loop-rs/`
  - `Cargo.toml` - Project dependencies
  - `src/lib.rs` - Module exports
  - `src/main.rs` - CLI with clap, signal handling
  - `src/error.rs` - RalphError enum with thiserror
  - `src/config.rs` - Config struct with TOML support
  - `src/agent.rs` - Agent trait + ClaudeAgent implementation
  - `src/loop_controller.rs` - LoopController with mock tests
  - `src/token_counter.rs` - Tiktoken, ByteRatio, CharRatio methods
  - `src/process.rs` - ClaudeProcess subprocess wrapper
  - `src/monitor.rs` - Concurrent stdout/stderr monitoring
  - `src/state.rs` - SharedState with RwLock

### Tests Pass
- 10 unit tests passing
- `cargo clippy` - no warnings
- `cargo fmt --check` - passes

### TLA+ Verification
- Fixed specification with `Done` action for terminal states
- Both configurations pass:
  - `RalphLoop.cfg` (bounded mode): 1,928 states, all properties verified
  - `RalphLoopInfinite.cfg` (infinite mode): 3,318 states, all properties verified

### CI Workflow
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with check, test, fmt, clippy, and release build jobs

### Commit
- Committed locally (push requires authentication which isn't configured on this system)

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
