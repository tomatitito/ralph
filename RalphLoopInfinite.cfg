\* TLC Configuration for RalphLoop specification
\* This configuration tests INFINITE mode (HasMaxIterations = FALSE)

\* Constants - small values for tractable model checking
\* Note: ModelBound is required to make model checking finite, but represents
\* that the actual implementation would run indefinitely
CONSTANTS
    HasMaxIterations = FALSE
    MaxIterations = 0           \* Unused in infinite mode, but must be declared
    ContextLimit = 5
    ModelBound = 5              \* Artificial bound for model checking only

\* Invariants (Safety Properties)
INVARIANTS
    TypeOK
    SuccessImpliesPromise
    FailedOnlyInBoundedMode
    InfiniteModeNeverFails
    TerminalStateExclusive

\* Properties (Liveness)
\* Note: EventualTermination is NOT checked in infinite mode - the loop
\* intentionally runs forever if promise not found and no shutdown requested.
\* The other liveness properties still hold.
PROPERTIES
    ShutdownEventuallyHandled
    PromiseLeadsToSuccess
    ContextLimitLeadsToKill
